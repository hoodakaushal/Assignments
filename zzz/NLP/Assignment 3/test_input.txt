Motor

the
characteristic

of

,
which
is
caused
by
mutations
in

.

Consequently
,
86
%
of

though
mutations
in

Since

The
initiation
and
progression
of
cancer
is
controlled
by
both
genetic
and
epigenetic
events
.

Unlike
genetic
alterations
,
which
are
almost
impossible
to
reverse
,
epigenetic
aberrations
are
potentially
reversible
,
allowing
the
malignant
cell
population
to
revert
to
a
more
normal
state
.

With
the
advent
of
numerous
drugs
that
target
specific
enzymes
involved
in
the
epigenetic
regulation
of
gene
expression
,
the
utilization
of
epigenetic
targets
is
emerging
as
an
effective

valuable
approach
to
chemotherapy
as

as
chemoprevention
of

In

However
,
few
studies
have
been
done
on
the
treatment

of
chronic

We
conducted
a
retrospective

Tuberculosis
is
one
of
the
major
public
health
risk
factors
of
high
mortality
among
patients
in
Zambia

The
prevalence
of
tuberculosis
among

has
more

doubled
since
the

in
Zambia
[

,
with
most
of
the
cases
often
related
to
HIV

Studies
[

have
shown
that

creates
a
lot
of
self

denial
among
those
with

like
Tuberculosis
and
Sexually

Infections
(

It
is
argued
that
the
proportion
of
fear

important
treatment
implications

To

to
determine
whether
the
enhancement

provides
a
more
ethically
feasible
approach
to

than
does
the

No

were
found
between
